  //DDRx is an 8-bit register which stores configuration information for the pins of Portx.
  //Writing a 1 in the pin location in the DDRx makes the physical pin of that port
  //an output pin and writing a 0 makes that pin an input pin

  //PIND is an 8-bit register that stores the logic value, the current state,
  //of the physical pins on PortD.
  //So to read the values on the pins of PortD,
  //you read the values that are in its PIN register.

  while True do

    //NOTE: In input mode, when pull-up is enabled, default state of pin becomes = 1.
    //So even if you donâ€™t connect anything to pin and if you try to read it, it will read as 1.
    //Now, when you externally drive that pin to zero
    //(i.e. connect to ground / or pull-down),only then it will be read as 0.
